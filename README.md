Scheduler: Assigns AI agents or container workloads to available nodes based on resource availability, priorities, and policies.

Controller/Orchestrator: Oversees the desired state of AI agent clusters, scaling, rolling updates, fault recovery, and coordination.

Networking Manager: Handles secure communication, service discovery, and routing between AI agents distributed across nodes.

Storage Manager: Manages persistent data storage needed by AI agents for state, logs, or shared datasets.

Security and Policy Enforcer: Applies authentication, authorization, and runtime policies for agent behaviors and resource access.

API Server: Exposes interfaces to users or automated systems for controlling and querying the AI agent orchestration.
